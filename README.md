# IOC-Container-JS

## This is a small JavaScript project which contains a custom Inversion of Control container.

* The repo contains the IocContainer class and accompanying unit tests (Jest.js).

I built the IOC container from scratch and intend it to be a lightweight dependency injection method for any JavaScript project.

### To Do:

* Include support for singleton pattern, and potentially scoped/transient object lifetimes.
* Include support for primitive type instantiation.
